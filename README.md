**KLMC** is a community-driven fork of the Modrinth App.

Our goal is to evolve the launcher into something bigger:  
**privacy-first**, **ad-free**, **full offline/cracked accounts support**, **CurseForge integration**, and — most importantly — **built-in social features** that turn the launcher into a real community hub.

---

## 🎯 Vision: The Next Generation Launcher

We’re working to create a launcher that feels like home for the entire Minecraft community:

- In-app text chat, voice & video calls  
- User profiles, friends, status updates, avatars  
- Activity feed: share screenshots, modpacks, servers, worlds  
- Seamless mod & modpack downloads from **Modrinth + CurseForge**  
- Complete support for offline / cracked accounts  
- No telemetry, no ads, no tracking

---

## ⚠️ Current Status

KLMC is actively developed and still growing.

What’s already working:
- Ads removed
- Full offline/cracked account support
- All core Modrinth features preserved

Social features and CurseForge integration are in progress / planned.
